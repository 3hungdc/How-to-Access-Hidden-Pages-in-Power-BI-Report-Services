I fixed my problem by following instruction in this article: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Report-Server/There-is-no-data-in-the-database-for-catalogitemid/td-p/1716998

ROOT CAUSE

===========

Change to GetCatalogExtendedContentData stored procedure via fix in May 2020

ICM 179612428

User Story 324871: Incident 179612428 : CSS – PBIRS/PBIX Reports display a blank page when executed during the SaveToCatalog Step during Schedule/OnDemand Refresh (3/13)

===========

WORKAROUND

=============

To revert back to the previous version of the GetCatalogExtendedContentData stored procedure, you can replace this:

   

SELECT 

        DATALENGTH([Content]) AS ContentLength, 

        [Content] 

    FROM 

        [CatalogItemExtendedContent] WITH (NOWAIT) -- DevNote: Using NOWAIT here because for large models the row might be locked for long durations. Fail fast and let the client retry. 

    WHERE 

        [ItemID] = @CatalogItemID AND ContentType = @ContentType
 

With this:

       

SELECT 

        DATALENGTH([Content]) AS ContentLength, 

        [Content] 

    FROM 

        --[CatalogItemExtendedContent] WITH (NOWAIT) -- DevNote: Using NOWAIT here because for large models the row might be locked for long durations. Fail fast and let the client retry. 

        [CatalogItemExtendedContent] WITH (READPAST) -- Pre-May 2020 code 

    WHERE 

        [ItemID] = @CatalogItemID AND ContentType = @ContentType
